Tool to manage a [Letaa](https://www.letta.com/) (formerly MemGPT) server and agents

I enrolled in the course at [DeepLearning.ai](https://DeepLearning.ai) on [LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memory/) and thought this was a real project. The course helped me understand 'MemGPT' and a few of its practical applications.

I decided to start trying to create my first Open WebUI Tool. I had some struggles with it at first and then started pair programming with DeepSeek to get it working. However, the tool "Web Search using SearXNG and Scrape first N Pages" from the OpenWebUI Tool repo was a great worked example to get started.

This tool provides a frontend for the Letta Server.

Please submit Pull Requests to help contribute and further develop this tool.

I'll slowly add more commands as I use the different features in Letta.

*NOTE: Ensure you visit the Letta site and setup the Letta server.*
